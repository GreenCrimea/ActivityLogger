instructions to run using exp1.csv under optimal circumstances

IF IT HANGS, MOST LIKELY ITS THE EXPORT GRAPHICS FUNCTIONS AT THE END OF EVERY PLOT.
SOMETIMES THE RENDER ENGINE RANDOMLY SHITS ITSELF, NO IDEA WHY OR HOW TO FIX.
JUST COMMENT OUT ANY LINES CONTAINING "exportgraphics()" FUNCTIONS.

SMOOTH_K = [750, 250]
THRESHOLDS = [0.1, 0.6]
THESE ARE IDEAL PARAMS TO GET 90% ACCURACY WITH exp1.csv

IDEAL TRUNK AND LABEL INPUTS:

Input the path to the accelerometer dataset: 
exp1.csv
Would you like to truncate dataset? 1 = Yes, 0 = No :
1
Input amount to remove off the beginning of the dataset in seconds (use decimals if neccesary): 
8
Input amount to remove off the end of the dataset in seconds (use decimals if neccesary): 
9
Would you like to truncate dataset? 1 = Yes, 0 = No :
0
Would you like to start again, 1 = Yes, 0 = No :
0
Would you like to add labels to the data? 1 = Yes, 0 = No :
1
Input the start of the range in seconds :
0
Input the end of the range in seconds :
5
Input what label, 1=sit, 2=stand, 3=walk :
1
are the labels complete? 1 = Yes, 0 = No :
0
Input the start of the range in seconds :
5
Input the end of the range in seconds :
10
Input what label, 1=sit, 2=stand, 3=walk :
2
are the labels complete? 1 = Yes, 0 = No :
0
Input the start of the range in seconds :
10
Input the end of the range in seconds :
17
Input what label, 1=sit, 2=stand, 3=walk :
3
are the labels complete? 1 = Yes, 0 = No :
1

IDEAL RANGE FOR predict_in_range() = 6-10s
